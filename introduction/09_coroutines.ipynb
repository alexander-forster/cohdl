    "Pythons async/await coroutines were the initial motivation for **Co**HDL. Coroutines are functions that can suspend and resume their execution. CoHDL translates coroutines into VHDL state machines. This translation process is completely deterministic and makes it possible to describe sequential processes clock cycle accurate."

    "The `async` keyword turns functions into coroutines. Only `asnyc def` functions can use `await` expressions in the function body.\n",

    "For CoHDL there are two different types of await expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "* awaiting primitive expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "    When the argument of `await` is a Signal/Variable/Temporary, the coroutines execution is suspended, until that argument becomes truthy (non-zero). Each wait takes at least one clock cycle even if the argument is already true. `await` expressions define wait states, the code between two awaits is executed once when transitioning from one wait to the next. These primitive awaits are the building blocks for more complex sequential processes.\n",
    "* awaiting coroutine functions\n",
    "\n",
    "    When the argument of `await` is itself a coroutine, CoHDL treats that expression similar to a normal function call. The function body - that may contain nested `await` expressions - is translated and inlined at the call site."
