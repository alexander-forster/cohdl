    "    * constant in synthesizable contexts (except in `__init__` methods to allow the construction of local objects)\n",
    "    * are used to structure type qualified objects and metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "## references\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python assignments using the `=` operator do not copy values. Instead the name at the left hand side becomes a reference to the object at the right hand side. The same is true in synthesizable contexts, with the additional limitation that defined references can not be overwritten. Every variable name can only be defined once per function (for loops and generator expressions are exceptions to this rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "All references to the same object are aliases and interchangeable without affecting the resulting VHDL. As in normal Python function arguments, list/dict elements and class members are also implemented as references.\n",

When the CoHDL compiler encounters a push assignment it inserts a reset expression (assignment of the default value) at the start of the context. This operator is limited to sequential contexts and only defined for signals with default values. Push- and next-assignment are mutually exclusive, they can not be applied to the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ports are used to define inputs and outputs of entities and may only be declared at entity scope. Apart from an additional direction property, they are normal Signals. It is not possible to write to input ports. Unlike VHDL, CoHDL allows to read from outputs, the compiler inserts buffer signals (it does not change the port type to buffer).\n",

    "* Temporary\n",

    "    All operations that depend on type qualified objects return Temporaries. It is also possible to construct them explicitly like Signals and Variables. Temporaries are constant for their entire lifetime, it is not possible to assign new values to them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Inside coroutines CoHDL restricts the usage of Temporaries to a single state. The idea behind this is to limit the lifetime of temporary objects and prevent registers from being inferred. Ideally Temporaries should never turn into latches/flip-flops, but this is currently not enforced in every circumstance."
